A pre-prepared model is a spared organize that was recently prepared on an enormous dataset, commonly for a huge scope picture arrangement task. You either utilize the pretrained model with no guarantees or use move figuring out how to modify this model to a given errand. 

The instinct behind exchange learning for picture characterization is that if a model is prepared on a huge and general enough dataset, this model will successfully fill in as a nonexclusive model of the visual world. You would then be able to exploit these educated component maps without beginning without any preparation via preparing a huge model on a huge dataset. 

In this note pad, you will attempt two different ways to redo a pretrained model: 

Highlight Extraction: Use the portrayals learned by a past system to extricate significant highlights from new examples. You just include another classifier, which will be prepared without any preparation, on head of the pretrained model so you can repurpose the component maps adapted beforehand for the dataset. 

You don't have to (re)train the whole model. The base convolutional arrange as of now contains highlights that are conventionally valuable for grouping pictures. Be that as it may, the last, characterization part of the pretrained model is explicit to the first arrangement task, and hence explicit to the arrangement of classes on which the model was prepared. 

Adjusting: Unfreeze a couple of the top layers of a solidified model base and together train both the recently included classifier layers and the last layers of the base model. This permits us to "tweak" the higher-request highlight portrayals in the base model so as to make them more pertinent for the particular undertaking. 

You will follow the overall AI work process. 

1. Look at and comprehend the information 

2. Construct an info pipeline, for this situation utilizing Keras ImageDataGenerator 

3. Form the model 

	a.load the pretrained base model (and pretrained loads) 

	b. Stack the classification layers on top 

4. Train the model 

5. Assess model
